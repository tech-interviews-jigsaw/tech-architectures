    "asyncio.gather() is a utility function in the asyncio library that allows you to schedule multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and collect their results when they all complete. It takes one or more coroutines or asyncio.Future objects as arguments, runs them concurrently, and returns an asyncio.Future object representing the aggregated results of all tasks.\n",

    "You don't always need asyncio.gather() when writing asynchronous code, but it is very useful in situations where you want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Run multiple tasks concurrently and efficiently.\n",
    "Wait for all tasks to complete before proceeding.\n",
    "Collect the results of all tasks in the same order as the input coroutines.\n",

    "What are some alternatives to using asyncio.gather\n",

    "\n",
    "asyncio.as_completed():\n",
    "This function takes an iterable of coroutines or futures and returns an iterator that yields futures as they complete. You can use this when you want to process the results as soon as they are available, rather than waiting for all tasks to complete.\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "import asyncio\n",

    "This function takes an iterable of coroutines or futures and returns a pair of sets (done, pending) once the specified condition is met (e.g., all tasks are done, at least one task is done, etc.). You can use this when you want more control over how to wait for tasks to complete.\n",
