    "When writing code that involves a good amount of waiting, we can implement asynchronous programming so that we can reduce this waiting time.  What's a task where we may need to wait -- well this will be something like making a request to an API, or scraping a website.  As we'll see, by using *asynchronous* programming, we can have our Python thread move onto other tasks so that it doesn't just sit there waiting."

    "In other words, making four slow calls to the API took the same amount of time as making one slow call to the API.  Why is that?  It's because instead of waiting for one api call to complete, our Python thread immediately moved onto the next coroutine of making another call to the API.  It began each function call in about .002 seconds, and then each function call completed two seconds later.  So by moving to asynchronous programming we saved ourselves, and our users, well six seconds.  In other words, synchronous programming would have taken us four times as long. "
