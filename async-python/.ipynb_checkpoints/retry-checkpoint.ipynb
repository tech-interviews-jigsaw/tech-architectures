    "When writing code that involves a good amount of waiting, we can implement asynchronous programming so that we no longer need to wait.  What's a task where we may need to wait -- well this will be something like making a request to an API, or scraping a website.  As we'll see, by using *asynchronous* programming, we can have Python move onto other tasks while it waits for the long running task to be completed."
